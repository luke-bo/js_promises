//     console.log(arrayOfValues);
//   })
//   .catch(err => { // if any of the promises passed to Promise.all() are rejected the whole thing rejects
//     console.log(err);
//   })

// Promise.race
// this method accepts an array of promises and it will resolve the very first promise that resolves
